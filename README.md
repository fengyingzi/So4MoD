# So4MoD

This repository contains method implementation in the paper "So4MoD: Towards a Security-optimized Approach for the Microservices-oriented Decomposition" and experimental evaluation projects data.

The evaluation projects information statistics is presented in "Evaluation projects information statistics.xlsx", and the specific projects data is in path "So4MoD-ApproachImplementation\data-7". And the method implementation is in path "So4MoD-ApproachImplementation\So4MoD\codeDepends\src\main\java\methodImplementation".

If you want to run the code of the method or reproduce the results of our experiments, you can do the following:

1. Place the data:

   The data needed by the method is placed in the path "So4MoD/src/main/dataFiles", and the current data is that of the JPetStore project, which can be used directly.

2. Run the nsga2 codes:

   To run nsga2 just run the file "So4MoD-ApproachImplementation\So4MoD\codeDepends\src\main\java\methodImplementation\nsga\NSGAService.java".

3. Run the evaluation computing codes:

   If you need to see the results of the calculations, please run the file "So4MoD-ApproachImplementation\So4MoD\codeDepends\src\main\java\methodImplementation\nsga\assessment\Caculate.java".

PS: If you want to change the evaluation projects, please put the data in path "So4MoD-ApproachImplementation\data-7" to the path in Step 1.
